  %p.desc
    Joe sells restaurant equipment. He&#8217;s having a rough time getting people to give him a call back though.
    He usually hands out his business card and never hears back.

  %p#joe Here be sad Joe.
  %p.desc
    He has some promotions he would like to offer his contacts, 
    but they don&#8217;t take the time to call him up or write him an email.

  %h2 Here&#8217;s an example:
  %p.desc
    Joe goes to a friend&#8217;s barbecue. He strikes up a conversation with Kevin who is just
    starting his own restaurant. Kevin&#8217;s looking for some large pots. Joe takes out one of his conne.cc cards,
    hands half of one to Kevin.

  %h2 After the party
  %p.desc
    Joe goes to http://conne.cc/d28cx to write a message for Kevin.
    He wants to offer Kevin a 20% discount on a few pots. So now when Kevin visits that website on the card, he gets this:
  %p#joe
    Kevin, it was nice meeting you at the barbecue. Give me a call sometime,
    I&#8217;d like to offer you a 20% discount on some of those pots we were talking about.

  %h2 Why is this better?
  %p.desc
    %ul
      %li Kevin doesn&#8217;t have to place a confrontational phone call.
      %li Kevin doesn&#8217;t have to write a time consuming email.
      %li Kevin can check out the offer without making any commitment.

  %h2 Think it could work?
